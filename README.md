# Hückel method

Throughout using the Jacobi method to diagonalize the Hamiltonian matrix we can
compute the energies and the coefficients for the wave function in the Hückel
method. Is also computable the total energy for $\pi$-system.

With these program we have some interesting results for the next molecules: $i$)
1,3-butadiene, $ii$) cyclopentadiene anion, $iii$) benzene, $iv$) naphthalene $v$)
pyrene and $vi$) coronene. The input files for these molecules are in the
repository.
